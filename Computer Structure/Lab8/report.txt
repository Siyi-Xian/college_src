Difficulties and What did you learn:
When putting together 3 lab's code, easy to confuse about initilization all pins. Some pins actually do not need to initalize.

Q1) In previous labs, adding a peripheral has required pin initializations. Why were able to add the nunchuk without initializing anything?
Because we use I2C with direct address of pins. Thus we do not need to initialize.

Q2) What are the major differences between these two functions and what does that imply about communicating with the nunchuk?
Nunchuk has constant address of devices. And use automatice mode.

Q3) What do all of these variables correspond to in the nunchuk? Hint: It may be best to answer this question after the checkpoint
jx, jy: status of operating lever
ax, ay, az: rotate status
c, z: switch c and z

Q4) Explain the code above.
4 cases: 00 01 10 11. first digit is status of z second is status of c.
