Difficulties [5]:
Read bmp image from sd card and transfer color from 24 bits to 16 bits.

What did you learn [5]:
Using shift instead of times is much more easy and faster.

Q1.) What are we doing here and how does it relate to what we know about SPI?
Set SD card to be read or not. 

Q2.) Explain how you might use the *f3d_delay_uS()* function within the *delay()* function to replace the delay loop below. What would you expect to be the advantage of using a timer over a delay loop?
replace asm("nop") with the new function. It will be more acurrate than the previouse one.

Q3.) Read chapter 12 in the lab manual which covers DMA (direct memory access). Why might DMA be important in improving the performance of your image display application?
Increasing speed to read and write data. 

Q4.) Research the FAT file system and describe the function of the file allocation table. Explain how the corruption of an entry in the table can cause part of a file to be lost.
It might be changed when using and broken when accidentally eject.

Q5.) What is the difference between FAT16 and FAT32?
FAT16 has a memory block with 16 bits but FAT32 has a 32 bits block.
