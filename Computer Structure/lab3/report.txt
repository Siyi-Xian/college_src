What are the public attributes of the GPIO_InitTypeDef Struct?
uint32_t		GPIO_Pin
GPIOMode_TypeDef 	GPIO_Mode
GPIOSpeed_TypeDef 	GPIO_Speed
GPIOOType_TypeDef 	GPIO_OType
GPIOPuPd_TypeDef 	GPIO_PuPd

Were there any difficulties? If not, what did you learn? [5 points]
At first I am not familiar with the structure of main function, it takes me a long time to find out how to put push button to turn on in program. Then I find out that 'while' is where we put code. And 'while(1)' make sure we have program run in infinite loop.
